Eight files are included besides this Notes file.
Six are sequence files:
  s_8_1_test.txt and s_8_2_test.txt (82,874 read pairs)
  s_7_1_test.txt and s_7_2_test.txt (80,632 read pairs)
  s_6_1_test.txt and s_6_2_test.txt (78,389 read pairs)
These are fastq-formatted files of paired end reads alignable to chromosome 3 of Arabidopsis.
Most reads are from 10 regions of chromosome 3. 

195000 to 198000
4061000 to 4062000
9796000 to 9797000
14198000 to 14203000
15988000 to 15989000
16526000 to 16529000
17493000 to 17495000
20339000 to 20341000
22454000 to 22457000
22746000 to 22747000

The lanes vary in the content of reads in the region 22454000 to 22457000. Some 7,500 
read pairs were included that align to common contaminants found in RNA-Seq experiments and in proportions
roughly like that of some experiments:
6000 Arabidopsis rRNA
 500 Arabidopsis plastid genome
 500 Arabidopsis mitochondrial genome
 500 PhiX

Quality scores for these reads were generated by the Illumina pipeline v 1.5.


The Arabidopsis reads were created from inserts of 268 bases and are of length 84 and 
were generously supplied by Dr. Chris Pires, University of Missouri, and Dr. Claude dePamphilis, 
Pennsylvania State University.
The source of the contaminants is described below. 
The program wgsim from Samtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) was used to create the paired end 
sequences for the contaminants and their quality scores were copies of values in the supplied 
Arabidopsis data.


chrom3.fa is the sequence of the Arabidopsis chromosome 3 from ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Sequences/whole_chromosomes/

Contaminants.fa is a file of contaminants including the following:
